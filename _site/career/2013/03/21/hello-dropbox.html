<p>After two years at Facebook I couldn&#8217;t be more proud. Proud to have been part of something as important as Facebook and proud of the work I&#8217;ve done with shaping the future of mobile communication. It&#8217;s truly been a fantastic time of my life — an experience rich of great people, mind-boggling challenges and once-in-a-lifetime experiences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at the past for inspiration, but focus on the future, because tomorrow is shaped by the choices we make today.</p>

<p>At Dropbox I&#8217;m going to work hard to make all our lives better. Remove friction from technical details in our modern daily lives, and relieve us from worrying about our &#8220;stuff&#8221; — from quick snapshots and hasty notes to precious memories.</p>

<p>This is going to be such a fun adventure.</p>
