	<h1>An expensive photo frame</h1>
	<p class="meta">13 Mar 2011</p>
	<p>This weekend&#8217;s hack is an iPad app which displays your Facebook news feed in a &#8220;photo frame&#8221; fashion — large text, automatic, simplistic and suitable for passive viewing.</p>

<p><a href='http://rsms.me/projects/fnews/'><img src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5017/5522785997_b9e2ff887d_z.jpg' alt='Photo' /></a></p>

<p>I never really got the iPad (my laptop or smartphone is always around) and have probably used it for about a total of 10 hours, so better make good use of the thing.</p>

<p>The app is actually a web app. iOS web apps are perfect for these simple hacks as no super-mega performance is required and the hassle of getting a native app on the App Store would yield more work than actually building the app.</p>

<p><strong>Visit <a href='http://rsms.me/projects/fnews/'>rsms.me/projects/fnews</a></strong> in your iPad, add the app to your Home Screen and start it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s built on the <a href='https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/'>Facebook Graph API</a> which provides a smooth and low-barrier user experience.</p>

<p><strong>The &#8220;like&#8221; button</strong> is unfortunately somewhat defunct as the only API for &#8220;like&#8221; is the Open Graph one which causes the <em>app</em> to like something <em>rather than the user</em>. <strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;ve added a request for the <a href='https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/'><code>publish_stream</code> permission</a>. If you already have connected Fnews with Facebook, you&#8217;ll need to log out (tap the hard-to-see gear in the bottom-right corner) and then log in again to give Fnews the rights to &#8220;like&#8221; something on your behalf. I really wish there was a separate <code>publish_like</code> permission as <code>publish_stream</code> sounds really scary to most users and will probably lower the user count. Anyhow, <em>&#8220;Like&#8221; to the people!</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Foursquare check-ins</strong> use maps from Google Maps (the Static Map API) rather than Foursquare as their (Foursquare&#8217;s) API is too complex for this quick hack. Google Maps are prettier anyway. I never managed to &#8220;snapshot&#8221; any Gowalla check-ins during the weekend (they are relatively rare in my perspective), so currently no Gowalla &#8220;candy additions&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Logging in to Facebook</strong> using the <a href='https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/'>Facebook JavaScript API</a> should be avoided in &#8220;web apps&#8221; as it relies on <code>window.open</code>, which will cause a blank white screen to take over your app. This is a broken behavior of iOS &#8220;web apps&#8221; framework. Instead, when logging in to Facebook while in &#8220;web app&#8221; mode, Fnews simply sends you to Facebook, which eventually sends you back to Fnews (thought HTTP 302). It&#8217;s not pretty but it works. Note that although the <a href='https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.ui/'><code>FB.ui</code></a> API supports iframe dialogs, there&#8217;s an exception for authentication dialogs which must be opened in separate windows.</p>

<p><strong>Instagram pictures</strong> turned out to be rather simple to acquire as they provide a simpler <a href='http://instagram.com/developer/embedding/'>&#8220;embedding&#8221; API</a> — in addition to their full-blown OAuthed behemoth API — which allows to simply concatenate a regular link URL with &#8220;media&#8221; to build a higher-res image URL. Neat.</p>
